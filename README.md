# dynamicallySortedIfs
Testing dynamically sorted ifs

If a program contains many if-else clauses it makes sense to try the most frequently occurring conditions first. 

In our demo code we put conditions and called functions in an array that is then tried sequentially on input parts.

After an initial round the code assess the frequency of input parts and then sorsts the clauses accordingly.

Code is executed by
node demo.js
